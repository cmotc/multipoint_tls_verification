		  Description: This program retrieves the TLS certificate belonging to
		  to the URL it is passed from a group of up to 5 different Tor exit
		  nodes in order to detect differences between them(Such as those that
		  might imply a Man-In-The-Middle Attack directed at a certain
		  geograpic area. It currently DOES NOT protect against MITM attacks
		  that specifically target traffic coming out of Tor exit nodes, but it
		  may soon by adding support for querying convergence.io notaries and
		  namecoin resolvers as well. Use with great caution and read the code!

			usage:
				-u The URL to test.
				-s The number of different Tor exit nodes to retrieve the cert
					through.
				-v Verbose Mode(Inactive.)
				-h Displays this help message.
